# Pothole-detection-using-AI

In this project, we have developed a Machine Learning techniques for identifying potholes on road surfaces which aim at developing strategies for identification of potholes, to support real-time control of a vehicle (for driver assistance or autonomous driving) or offline data collection for road maintenance. 

Pothole are the primary cause of accidents, hence identification and classification using image processing techniques is very important. In this project image pre-processing will be implemented for better result. The main goal of this project is to identify a better method which is highly efficient and accurate compared to the conventional methods. Different image pre-processing and segmentation methods for pothole detection will be reviewed using performanceÂ measures.
